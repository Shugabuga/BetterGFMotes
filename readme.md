#BetterGFMotes

*We are on Reddit at [/r/BetterGFMotes](https://reddit.com/r/BetterGFMotes)*

##What is This?

BetterGFMotes is an Reddit/Voat emote script (similar to BetterPonymotes in functionality, but not affiliated with it) that allows the user to see more emotes than usual on Reddit, all over Reddit.

##Notice

This project is maintained by /u/HeyItsShuga (Shugabuga on GitHub), but includes image content from seperate designers. If you happen to be one of these designers and want your work removed, please let me know by PMing /u/HeyItsShuga on Reddit. If your emote is in the project, credit is given (if this is not the case, inform /u/HeyItsShuga to resolve this).

##Demo

[Our website](http://bettergfmotes.ga) has a demo of the emote selector on the homepage! It only is (officially) supported on the PC and Mac versions of Firefox and Chrome.

##Installation

The "Chrome" folder is for Google Chrome, and the "Firefox" folder is for Firefox. Install accordingly. Any other folders are not a part of the code yet.

- The `firefox.sh` file will build the Firefox version if you have XPInstall installed.

- You can use developer features in Google Chrome to build the Chrome installation.

##Configuration

- The `emotes.css` folder is where the emote CSS is stored, as with the modifier CSS. This file will be applied to the browser.

- The `modifiers.css` folder is where the emote modifiers (like -sepia) are stored.

- The `popup.html` is the list of emotes that appear when clicking the plug-in's icon. It is an HTML file.

- The `modifiers.html` is the list of modifiers that can be accessed via the plug-in's icon and opening the menu. It is an HTML file.

- The `credits.html` is the list of credits that can be accessed via the plug-in's icon and opening the menu. It is an HTML file.

- The `settings.html` is currently useless, but will be the settings page in a future update. It is an HTML file.

- The `settings.js` is a companion to `settings.html`.

- The `icon#.png` files are the icon for the plug-in. The # matches to the resolution, but the resolutions can be anything.

- The `code.js` (Chrome) and the `index.js` (Firefox) file are relatively useless as of version 0.6.0.

- The `manifest.json` and `package.json` (Firefox) stores version information and other crucial information.

- The `emote_list.js` (Firefox) file is for the plug-in icon.

- The `bettergfmotes_static.png / bettergfmotes_static.json` is for the emote spritesheet (for the HTML files).

- Chrome's `background.html` does nothing (yet).

**Note: Some files aren't mentioned above. If there is random letters, the word "legacy," or the word "old" before/after it, it's outdated.**

##Backend

The repository with all of the remote assets are hosted [here](https://github.com/Shugabuga/BetterGFMotesDB). The backend is not to be used at all, though (because of the hosting of emotes that aren't all mine). **Do NOT Fork the backend!**
