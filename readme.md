#BetterGFMotes

*We are on Reddit at [/r/BetterGFMotes](https://reddit.com/r/BetterGFMotes)*

##What is This?

BetterGFMotes is an Reddit emote script (similar to BetterPonyMotes) that allows the user to see more emotes than usual on Reddit, all over Reddit.

###Why Not BetterPonyMotes?

BetterGFMotes does not use any backend (and not that much JavaScript). Instead, this uses (mostly) CSS to show the user the emotes.

##Notice

This project is maintained by /u/HeyItsShuga (Shugabuga on GitHub), but includes image content from seperate designers. If you happen to be one of these deisgners and want your work removed, please let me know by PMing /u/HeyItsShuga on Reddit. 

##Installation

The "Chrome" folder is for Google Chrome, and the "Firefox" folder is for Firefox. Install accordingly.

- The `firefox.sh` file will build the Firefox version if you have XPInstall installed.

- You can use developer features in Google Chrome to build the Chrome installation.

##Configuration

-The `manual.css` folder is where the emote CSS is stored, as with the modifier CSS. This file will be applied to the browser.

- The `popup.html` is the list of emotes that appear when clicking the plug-in's icon. It is an HTML file.

- The `icon#.png` files are the icon for the plug-in. The # matches to the resolution.

- The `code.js` (Chrome) and the `index.js` (Firefox) file stores the JavaScript for loading the CSS into the browser.

- The `manifest.json` and `package.json` (Firefox) stores version information and other crucial information.

- The `emote_list.js` (Firefox) file is for the plug-in icon.

- Chrome's `background.html` does nothing (yet).
